# Fooder: a little Food Order App

This project was completed as part of the [Reactâ€”The Complete Guide 2024](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Way3@sgJDdX0pSpHHGNxXUiS_alzHsliDEDykD5HPBT6jUiFiX7_DZYL1vVy6sNQ1KpX_Kw==/) Course.

It had specific requisites, stated below but I've added my flare in some parts of the app, to further train some concepts. I've also ignored Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller (the course teacher) index.css and I've used Tailwind to practice it while building this.

Here's an overview of the main page:

## Goal

The goal of this app is to allow users to see the available meals, store them in a JSON, and send them to the front end using a simple API, add them to their cart, and then check out their order. When an order is submitted, the `orders.json` is also updated.

### Requisites

- Display the Available Meals
- Allow users to add meals to the cart
- Display the cart (on a modal) if the user opens it
- Display the checkout form (on a modal) from the cart

### Technical Details

- Fetch the dummy data from the backend (GET /meals)
- The cart data and user data need to be sent to the backend (POST /orders) for proper validation
- Any error regarding the submission should also be validated
- Loading states should also be considered (getting the meals, submitting the order)

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you need to have Node installed.

On the project root, make sure to run `npm install`, to install the required dependencies. To start the frontend, then run `npm run dev`.

To start the backend, go to `./backend/`, run `npm install` again, and then run `npm start`.

## Extra Features

To practice some React and design concepts, I've added these extra features:

### Available Meals page

- Added a filter mechanism that allows the user to filter by meal category;
- Added a notification every time the user adds something to the cart;
- Changed the price display to be on the top-right corner of the available meal card;
- Changed the "Add to Cart" button to two buttons and a counter, for the user to quickly see how many of those meals were already added to the cart. The buttons allow the user to add or remove, changing the quantity.

### Cart Page

- Changed the design for the user to visually see what's in the cart;
- Added a way for the user to remove every meal with a single click;

## To My Future Self (or anyone else!)

- Organize those Tailwind classes properly, please :P
- Migrate the Cart and User Context to Redux, instead of Context API (I didn't know Redux yet when building this lol).
- Add proper user authentication (something simple), to store the users and the orders in a proper database.
- Experiment with sending emails (but for real), at the end of a successful order.
- Have fun!

## To anyone reading...

Thank you for reading! I've had tons of fun with this project, and I'm loving learning React. I am, by no means, a Pro in this, so feel free to reach out to give some feedback and suggest improvements! Can't wait to create more stuff ðŸ‘€
